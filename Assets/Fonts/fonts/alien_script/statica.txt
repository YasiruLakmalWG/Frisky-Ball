This font is free to download and utilize for non-commercial purposes.  If you use this font for a commercial purpose, please contact me prior to use.  All I typically ask for is a copy of the publication for my private archive.  Not much to ask for.  

You may distribute this font consistent of the following restrictions:
1) Files contained within the ascript.zip file cannot be modified, changed or deleted - including this text file.
2) Proper recognition to Statica Productions must be made somewhere on the hosting website - I'd appreciate a link to my website, but it is not necessary.

Thanks...
