APOSTATE CANCER
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

This month, I do what I always do when I'm a few days late with the free font: I return to the well of stress. This time around the stressing is doubled up, with both a bottom-side corrosion and some heavy random flaking going on. This is a font that's having a bad 8 years.

Apostate Cancer is a full-keyboard set with both upper- and lowercase, plus the usual scattered extras. Enjoy!
