BASKETCASE-ROMAN(TM) TRUETYPE FONT FOR WINDOWS

Thank you very much for trying Basketcase-Roman.

I lost about six-hundred dollars worth of antique typeface books in a flood two 
years ago. A few were salvaged, albeit in lousy condition: pages stuck together, 
mud creamed into the thread of the folios, destruction of the spines.

Basketcase-Roman is the Phoenix risen from these sad and mulchified 
pages. I hope you enjoy it and find it useful. I know that its creation 
certainly helped me blot out my strong misgivings about the ways of Mother 
Nature.

This font is shareware. If you would like to keep and/or use Basketcase-Roman, 
please register it for $10. When you do so you will also receive a very nice 
bonus font. I give this special bonus font only to those who register their copy 
of Basketcase-Roman. You must register this font if you use it in any commercial 
projects.

If you would also like to receive the two other Basketcase typefaces to complete 
your Basketcase Family, plus a great secret bonus font, the total registration is $20.

Thank you very much for your support. It is what makes it possible for me to 
create these fonts for you, and is greatly appreciated.
