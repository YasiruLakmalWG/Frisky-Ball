Commercial use in any manner, including (but not limited to) use in

manner, the author and copyright holder of the fonts can best retain

ask in advance.

NOTE TO PERSONAL USERS: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using
this font in some manner. If you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!

Black Wolf? Why not? There are black bears and black cats and black
sheep, so why discriminate against the wolf? It's just a plain version
of Grey Wolf anyway. And it's 1:00am. You can't see a black wolf in
the dark so who cares?
