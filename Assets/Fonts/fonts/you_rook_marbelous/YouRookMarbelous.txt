The character set includes:

Upper and lower case letters, numbers and the vast majority of 
international characters and punctuation. 

SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
[alt0164] is the Eurocurrency symbol.
[alt0166] is "Th"
[alt0175] is a narrow space you can use to add additional spacing
between characters, should you desire.

Fans of Billy Crystal will recognize the name as stemming from Billy's
Saturday Night Live impersonation of Ricardo Montalban. Since the font
features marble grained characters, it looks simply "marbelous"! And
marble was a lot easier to create than rich Corinthian leather.

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
do want to make a donation to encourage me to continue my creative
efforts, send it to the address above. (Yeah....As If!) Thanks & Enjoy!
